## Vagrant
I prefer to set up my environment in a vm, specifically using Vagrant. Here is just standard vagrant stuff.

```bash
mkdir browserpwnz
cd browserpwnz
vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64
```

As the ubuntu box only comes with 10gb and it's definitely not enough, install the `disksize` plugin.

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize
```

Then open the *Vagrantfile* and add this line into the config. I decided to give it 20GB but it could be anything.

```rb
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...
  config.disksize.size = '20GB'
end
```

The default cpu and ram settings for vagrant are quite stingy. To complete the build process successfully we need to give it more power.

```rb
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
    v.memory = 1024
    v.cpus = 2
  end

end
```

Now as we do `vagrant up`, vagrant will start our vm and the plugin will help us to resize the hard disk image. When the vm has finished booting, we can get a shell using `vagrant ssh`.

```
~/browserpwnz
▶ vagrant up

~/browserpwnz
▶ vagrant ssh

vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~
```

If we run `df -h`, we may see that our hard disk still only has 10GB. To make it the size we wanted, run `sudo cfdisk /dev/sda`. We will be presented with a nice looking interface. From here, just navigate to the `/dev/sda1` partition and choose the *resize* option at the bottom. 

(Something like the following but there should be a "free space" partition below `/dev/sda1`)

![cfdisk][cfdisk]

Once done, choose *write* to save the settings, and run `sudo resize2fs -P -f /dev/sda1`. (Not sure what the arguments do but it works I don't care)

## v8
Now that the environment is ready, it is time to build v8.

### Fetch source
There is this `depot_tools` repository that contains useful tools that will be needed in the following steps.

```bash
cd
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
export PATH=$PATH:~/depot_tools
gclient   # to update depot_tools
```

Once that's done, we can fetch the v8 repository.

```bash
mkdir ~/v8
cd ~/v8
fetch v8
cd v8
```

### Build v8
#### Using `gm`
There is a helper script that does all the work to build v8 in one command.

```
alias gm=~/v8/v8/tools/dev/gm.py
gm x64.debug
```

#### Manual way
The following steps may be longer but helpful if the build process above keeps failing, possibly due to insufficient RAM or CPU.

##### Generate build files using `v8gen`
```bash
alias v8gen=~/v8/v8/tools/dev/v8gen.py
v8gen x64.debug
```

##### Compile v8
Here is the problematic part as described earlier. I kept getting errors when using the commands in the docs. In the case where the compilation keeps failing, change the flags `-j` (number of jobs in parallel) and `-k` (number of fails before giving error). The following worked quite well for me.

```bash
ninja -C out/x64.debug -j 2 -k 10
```

That's it, `d8` can be found under `~/v8/v8/out/x64.debug/`.

## Turbolizer
Turbolizer is a tool to visualize TurboFan's (v8's JIT compiler) sea-of-nodes (how TurboFan represent JS code) graph.

Since turbolizer is a web app running on node.js, install nodejs first.

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Then build the files needed for turbolizer.

```bash
cd ~/v8/v8/tools/turbolizer
npm i
npm run-script build
```

With this, we can start the web server anytime and open the visualizing tool in Chrome.

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Alternatively, there is also a hosted version of turbolizer [here](https://thlorenz.com/turbolizer/).

## GDB
There is a very helpful gdbinit script for v8 debugging [here](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/tools/gdbinit), just copy the contents into `~/.gdbinit`.
